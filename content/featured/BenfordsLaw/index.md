I wrote a model that demonstrates Benford's Law. Benford's Law doesn't apply to data extracted from a specific range, as the maximum number in the dataset must be undetermined or infinite. For example, if a number generator extracts from a set range like 1-100, the first digit distribution will be uniform. However, when a computer or nature decides the range randomly each time, the dataset adheres to Benford's Law. I have written easy-to-understand code that proves that Benford's Law consistently holds true for randomly chosen numbers of randomly decided lengths.
