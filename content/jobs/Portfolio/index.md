- This website is built on React and Tailwind.
- Designed on Figma, developed using Gatsby. (Which I didn't love)
- Coded using Visual Studio Code and deployed on GitHub.
- Hosted for free on GitHub with a custom domain redirect setup.
- Shoutout to GitHub. Please, please, please, keep this free forever!
- Serverless, but utilizes a couple of GraphQL functions to fetch code from self-contained markup text.
